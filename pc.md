## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
a open source distributes a version control system that is free. it tracks changes made.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a system that saves many versions of code edits so that you can reload past saves in the event there is an issues which is transferred to a Git repository. Github is a place we can store repositories and make copies.
3. Why do we create a branch?
it gives you the freedoms to work independently on code within the repository. 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
to review and/or collaborate and suggest any changes made with others working on the repository.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
git checkout branch-name
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch: adds changes from a remote repository without committing. allows you to review changes before committing.
git merge: is to combine the changes between the two distinct branches.
git pull: is to update the code with updates of the remote counterpart from developers and teammates.
7. What is a merge conflict?
it's a difference that occurs between merged branches. When people make changes to the same line of the same file and/or deletes a file that is being edited by another.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
under your repository click on pull request. then click on the pull request with the merge conflict. click on resolve conflicts. decide what changes you want to keep then remove the conflict markers. make sure this is done to all conflicts in file. once completed click on mark as resolved. if other conflict pop up repeat the process. if no conflicts show up, commit merge. review if prompted to the branch you want to commit to.
